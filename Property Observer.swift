//*************** Notes **********************

/* The willSet and didSet observers of superclass properties are called when a property is set in a subclass initializer, after the superclass initializer has been called. They arenâ€™t called while a class is setting its own properties, before the superclass initializer has been called.
 */

/* If you pass a property that has observers to a function as an in-out parameter, the willSet and didSet observers are always called. This is because of the copy-in copy-out memory model for in-out parameters: The value is always written back to the property at the end of the function.
